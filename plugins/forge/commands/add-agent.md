description: Create a new agent for a plugin
---

Use the agent-writer agent to create a new agent for a plugin.

The agent-writer will:
- List available plugins to choose from
- Gather agent requirements and specifications
- Create properly formatted agent markdown file in the plugin's agents/ directory
- Follow agent-design skill patterns for autonomous delegation
