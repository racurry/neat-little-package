description: Create a new slash command in a plugin
---

Use the slash-command-writer agent to create a new slash command.

The agent will:
- List available plugins to choose from
- Gather command requirements (name, purpose, arguments, tool restrictions)
- Create the command markdown file in the appropriate plugin's commands directory
- Validate the command follows best practices

Provide the command name and purpose when ready.
