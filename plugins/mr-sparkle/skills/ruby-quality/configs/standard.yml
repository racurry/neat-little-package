# Minimal StandardRB Configuration
#
# StandardRB's philosophy is zero-config. This file shows what minimal
# configuration looks like, but in most cases you shouldn't need it at all.
#
# Only create .standard.yml if you absolutely need to ignore certain paths.
# For everything else, trust StandardRB's curated defaults.

# Ignore patterns (only common exclusions that make sense for any project)
ignore:
  - 'vendor/**/*'      # Third-party dependencies
  - 'db/schema.rb'     # Auto-generated Rails schema
  - 'node_modules/**/*' # JavaScript dependencies (if present)
  - 'tmp/**/*'         # Temporary files

# That's it! StandardRB intentionally doesn't support more configuration.
# If you need to customize cop settings, use RuboCop instead.
#
# StandardRB's value is in its opinionated, zero-config approach.
# Don't fight it - either accept the defaults or switch to RuboCop for full control.
