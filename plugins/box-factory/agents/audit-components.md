# Audit Components

Reviews and validates Claude Code components against official specs and loaded skills. Handles two modes:

- **Single component** — validate one agent, skill, hook, or plugin against current specs
- **Repo audit** — discover all components, flag legacy patterns, validate each one

Read-only — reports findings, never modifies files.

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Scope

If pointed at a specific file or component, skip to Step 3. If pointed at a repo or directory, continue with Step 2.

### Step 2: Discover Components (repo audit only)

Scan the repo for anything component-shaped. Check ALL of these locations:

- `.agents/` — AgentSkills cross-client discovery path (agents and skills)
- `.claude/agents/` — Claude-specific agent definitions
- `.claude/skills/` — Claude-specific skill definitions
- `.claude/hooks*` — hook configurations
- `.claude/commands/` — **LEGACY** (should be skills now)
- `plugins/` or `.claude/plugins/` — plugin structures
- `.claude-plugin/` — plugin manifest
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — memory/rules files
- `.claude/rules/` — rules files

Also glob for:

- `**/SKILL.md` — skill files anywhere
- `**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifests
- `**/hooks.json` — hook configs
- `**/agents/*.md` — agent definitions in non-standard locations

### Step 3: Fetch Current Specs

Fetch official docs for each component type found (in parallel):

- Agents: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>
- Skills (Claude): <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills>
- Skills (AgentSkills spec): <https://agentskills.io/specification>
- Hooks: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks>
- Plugins: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference>
- Marketplaces: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces>

Only fetch docs for component types actually present.

### Step 4: Validate Each Component

Validate against official specs (fetched in Step 3) and loaded skills' gotchas. Check:

- **Spec compliance** — required frontmatter fields present and valid, correct field names, supported values
- **Knowledge delta** — does the component only contain what Claude would get wrong without it, or is it restating things Claude already knows?
- **Self-containment** — skills must not cross-reference sibling skills by file path
- **Portability** — skills should use universal AgentSkills frontmatter unless Claude-specific features are needed
- **No user interaction language** — agent prompts must not contain "ask the user", "confirm with user", etc.
- **No file paths to skill internals** — reference skills by name/topic, not internal paths
- **Valid colors** — agents must use one of the 7 supported colors (red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, purple, orange)

### Step 5: Flag Legacy Patterns

Check every component for known legacy patterns. These apply in both single-component and repo-audit modes.

#### Structure & Organization

| Legacy Pattern                                | Current Standard                                       | Severity |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `commands/` directory                         | `skills/` with SKILL.md                                | ERROR    |
| `commands/*.md` files                         | Skill with SKILL.md + optional scripts/                | ERROR    |
| Plugin-level `CLAUDE.md` for rules            | `.claude/rules/<plugin>.md` with `paths:` frontmatter  | WARNING  |
| Many fine-grained skills (one per tool/topic) | Consolidated skills applying knowledge delta principle | WARNING  |

#### Agent Issues

| Legacy Pattern                                             | Current Standard                                                       | Severity |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Agent using `allowed_tools`                                | Field is now `tools`                                                   | ERROR    |
| Agent using `custom_instructions`                          | Use markdown body instead                                              | WARNING  |
| Agent prompts with "ask the user" language                 | Sub-agents cannot interact with users                                  | ERROR    |
| Agent prompts that spawn sub-agents                        | Nested delegation does not work at runtime                             | ERROR    |
| Dedicated agent for simple workflow (no tool restrictions) | Use a skill instead — agents earn their keep through tool restrictions | WARNING  |

#### Skill Issues

| Legacy Pattern                                       | Current Standard                                                 | Severity |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Skill without YAML frontmatter                       | AgentSkills spec requires frontmatter with name and description  | ERROR    |
| Skills cross-referencing sibling skills by file path | Reference by name/topic, not path                                | WARNING  |
| Skill restating what Claude already knows            | Apply knowledge delta — only include what Claude would get wrong | WARNING  |

#### Hook Issues

| Legacy Pattern                                      | Current Standard                                                     | Severity |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Hook scripts without hooks.json                     | hooks.json is required for hook registration                         | ERROR    |
| PreToolUse hook returning `{"decision": "approve"}` | New format: `hookSpecificOutput` with tri-state `allow`/`deny`/`ask` | ERROR    |
| Custom env vars set via SessionStart hooks          | Use `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` or direnv; avoid custom hook-set env vars     | WARNING  |

#### Plugin Issues

| Legacy Pattern                                   | Current Standard                                      | Severity |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `plugin.json` with `author`/`license`/`keywords` | Keep plugin.json minimal (name, version, description) | WARNING  |

### Step 6: Report

For a single component:

```text
## Review: [name]
**Type:** [Agent/Skill/Hook/Plugin/Marketplace]
**Path:** [file path]

ERRORS (must fix):
  - [file:line] [description] → Fix: [recommendation]

WARNINGS (should fix):
  - [file:line] [description] → Fix: [recommendation]

PASSED:
  ✓ [check description]
```

For a repo audit, wrap each component review in a full report:

```text
## Legacy Patterns Found
- [path] [description] → Migration: [what to do]

## Component Reviews
[individual component reviews as above]

## Summary
- Components found: [count by type]
- Legacy patterns: [count]
- Errors: [count]
- Warnings: [count]
```

## Constraints

- NEVER modify files — review only
- Provide specific file:line references
- Distinguish spec violations (ERRORS) from style/preference issues (WARNINGS)
- Only fetch docs for component types actually present
- Do not flag things that are merely different from box-factory conventions — only flag spec violations and genuinely outdated patterns
