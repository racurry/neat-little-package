Use the skill-writer agent to create a new skill for a plugin.

The skill-writer will:
- List available plugins to choose from
- Gather skill requirements and specifications
- Create properly formatted SKILL.md file in the plugin's skills/ directory
- Follow skill-design patterns for progressive knowledge disclosure
