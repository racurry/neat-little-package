## Overview

Doing git stuff in the way I prefer.  Git commits, talking to Github.

## Commands

Setup
```
/dmv:setup     # Walks through `gh` and github mcp config
```

Committing
```
/dmv:commit                                          # commits everything with terse language
/dmv:commit refactor authentication flow             # commits everything with message 'refactor authentication flow'
/dmv:commit-partial just the stuff related to auth   # commits just the stuff related to auth with a terse message
```
