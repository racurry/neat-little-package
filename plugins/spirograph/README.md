Get your shit together with a 3D-printed home organization toolkit.

## Skills

### System Selection

- `home-organization` - recommend systems (Gridfinity, OpenGrid, Neogrid, French Cleat, Underware, Deskware)

### OpenSCAD Code Generation

- `opengrid-openscad` - generate OpenSCAD code for OpenGrid/MultiConnect wall-mounted items
- `gridfinity-openscad` - generate OpenSCAD code for Gridfinity bins/baseplates
- `underware-openscad` - generate OpenSCAD code for Underware cable management channels
- `neogrid-openscad` - generate OpenSCAD code for NeoGrid drawer divider connectors

## QuackWorks Integration

Advanced parametric implementations are sourced from [QuackWorks](https://github.com/AndyLevesque/QuackWorks), an excellent OpenSCAD project for functional 3D prints. Skills reference QuackWorks for current specifications and parameters.
