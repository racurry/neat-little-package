- [ ] Add a skill or agent for a bunch of boilerplate github actions for claude
- [ ] Not sure which plugin. Make a hook that just outputs the location of any relevant tests to claude after a file changed. Eg, claude updates admin.py - automatically dump into session message "tests for admin.py are in test_admin.py". Do tools exist that support this? Could we generate a map on the fly on session start with another hook?
- [ ] How can we do plugin versioning with almost no effort from me?
