description: Test all agent colors by invoking each color test agent
---

Test all agent colors by invoking each one sequentially. For each agent, note whether it loaded successfully and what color appeared in the status line.

Invoke these agents IN ORDER, four at a time:

1. color-red
2. color-green
3. color-blue
4. color-yellow
5. color-magenta
6. color-cyan
7. color-white
8. color-black
9. color-gray
10. color-grey
11. color-purple
12. color-orange
13. color-redBright
14. color-greenBright
15. color-blueBright
16. color-yellowBright
17. color-magentaBright
18. color-cyanBright
19. color-whiteBright
20. color-blackBright

After invoking all agents, provide a summary table showing:

- Color name
- Whether it loaded (success/fail)
- Any notes about visibility or appearance

This tests which color values are actually supported by Claude Code's agent color field.
